Overview of BASH history
    history

Basic History Recall
    !! - Previous command
    !n - Nth previous command

Parameter Recall
    !* - All parameters from last command, excluding 0th (the command itself)
    !:n - Nth parameter from previous command (1 indexed)

Advanced Recall
    !?<search> - Previous command with the word <search> in it, if you want to use a command on such a recall you will need to close <search> with a ? ie., !?foo?
    !<command> - Previous <command>

From here on any one of !!, !n, !<command>, or !?<search>? will be referred to as <history ref>

Advanced Parameter Recall
    <history ref>:<n/^/$/*> - Nth, first, last, or all respectively of the history ref

Basic Replace
    ^foo^bar - Replace first occurrence of 'foo' with 'bar' in previous command

Advanced Replace
    <history ref>:s/foo/bar - Replace first occurrence of foo with bar in history ref
        Example: !395:s/sbiddle/shawn/
    <history ref>:gs/foo/bar - Replace all occurrences of foo with bar in history ref

Modifiers (These are essentially filters applied to a substitution) A "substitution" is any of the above ways to recall a previous command/parameter
    <substitution>:t - The "tail" of the string, ie., the filename in a path
        Example: !cat:t
    <substitution>:h - The "head" of the string, ie., the path minus the filename
    <substitution>:q - Surround the substitution with single quotes
    <substitution>:x - Split the substitution on spaces/newlines and then surround those with quotes
    Example:

    cat /foo/bar /baz/quz ... echo !cat:*:x echo '/foo/bar' '/baz/quz'

History settings All of these you can set in your .bashrc with export <setting>=<value>
    HISTSIZE (number) - How many entries to store (defaults to 500)
    HISTCONTROL (string) - Behavior of the history
        ignoredups - Don't put the command in your history if it's the same as the previous command
        ignorespace - Don't put the command in your history if there is leading whitespace. Useful if you want to run some commands without having them be in the bare history file
        ignoreboth - Both of the previous settings
