Default normal-mode bindings

This is a (non-exhaustive) list of the most common normal-mode bindings. Type :help to open the online help for more details.

    : — activate the command line
    Shift + Insert — enter "ignore mode". Press Shift + Insert again to return to "normal mode".
    ZZ — close all tabs and windows, but only "save" them if your about:preferences are set to "show your tabs and windows from last time"
    . — repeat the last command

You can try :help key to know more about key. If it is an existing binding, it will take you to the help section of the command that will be executed when pressing key. For example :help . will take you to the help section of the repeat command.
Navigating with the current page

    j/k — scroll down/up
    h/l — scroll left/right
    ^/$ — scroll to left/right margin
    gg/G — scroll to start/end of page
    f/F — enter "hint mode" to select a link to follow. F to open in a background tab (note: hint characters should be typed in lowercase)
    gi — scroll to and focus the last-used input on the page
    r/R — reload page or hard reload page
    yy — copy the current page URL to the clipboard
    [[/]] — navigate forward/backward though paginated pages, for example comics, multi-part articles, search result pages, etc.
    ]c/[c — increment/decrement the current URL by 1
    gu — go to the parent of the current URL
    gU — go to the root domain of the current URL
    gr — open Firefox reader mode (note: Tridactyl will not work in this mode)
    zi/zo/zz — zoom in/out/reset zoom
    <C-f>/<C-b> — jump to the next/previous part of the page

Find mode

Find mode is still incomplete and uses the Firefox feature "Quick Find". This will be improved eventually.

    / — open the find search box
    <C-g>/<C-G> — find the next/previous instance of the last find operation (note: these are the standard Firefox shortcuts)

Please note that Tridactyl overrides Firefox's <C-f> search, replacing it with a binding to go to the next part of the page. If you want to be able to use <C-f> again to search for things, use unbind <C-f>.
Bookmarks and quickmarks

    A — bookmark the current page
    a — bookmark the current page, but allow the URL to be modified first
    M<key> — bind a quickmark to the given key
    go<key>/gn<key>/gw<key> — open a given quickmark in current tab/new tab/new window

If you want to use Firefox's default <C-b> binding to open the bookmarks sidebar, make sure to run unbind <C-b> because Tridactyl replaces this setting with one to go to the previous part of the page.
Navigating to new pages:

    o/O — open a URL (or default search) in this tab (O to pre-load current URL)
    t/T — open a URL (or default search) in a new tab (T to pre-load current URL)
    w/W — open a URL (or default search) in a new window (W to pre-load current URL)
    p/P — open the clipboard contents in the current/new tab
    s/S — force a search using the default Tridactyl search engine, opening in the current/new tab. This is useful when searching for something that would otherwise be treated as a URL by o or t
    H/L — go back/forward in the tab history
    gh/gH — go to the pages you have set with set home [url1] [url2] ...

Handling tabs

    d — close the current tab
    u — undo the last tab/window closure
    gt/gT — go to the next/previous tab
    g^/g$ — go to the first/last tab
    b — bring up a list of open tabs in the current window; you can type the tab ID or part of the title or URL to choose a tab
    <<|>> - move tabs next & previous

Extended hint mode

Extended hint modes allow you to perform actions on page items:

    ;i/;I — open an image (in current/new tab)
    ;s/;a — save/save-as the linked resource
    ;S/;A — save/save-as the selected image
    ;p — copy an element's text to the clipboard
    ;P — copy an element's title/alt text to the clipboard
    ;y — copy an element's link URL to the clipboard
    ;# — copy an element's anchor URL to the clipboard
    ;r — read the element's text with text-to-speech
    ;k — delete an element from the page
    ;; — focus an element

Additionally, you can hint elements matching a custom CSS selector with :hint -c [selector] which is useful for site-specific versions of the standard f hint mode.
Binding custom commands

You can bind your own shortcuts in normal mode with the :bind command. For example :bind J tabprev to bind J to switch to the previous tab. See :help bind for details about this command.
