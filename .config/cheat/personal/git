If you want to list all the files currently being tracked under the branch master, you could use this command:
  git ls-tree -r master --name-only
Merge selected files between branches
  git merge --no-ff --no-commit branchX

Let's say that your remote is git@xyz.git and you want its random_branch branch. The process should be as follows:

    First check the list of your remotes by

        git remote -v

    If you don't have the git@xyz.git remote in the above command's output, you would add it by

        git remote add xyz git@xyz.git

    Now you can fetch the contents of that remote by

        git fetch xyz

    Now checkout the branch of that remote by

        git checkout -b my_copy_random_branch xyz/random_branch

    Check the branch list by

        git branch -a

The local branch my_copy_random_branch would be tracking the random_branch branch of your remote.
